Today's challenges were a mix of string manipulation and linked list traversal. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what I worked on:

ðŸŒ€ Rotate String Problem Statement: 
Given two strings, s and goal, determine if s can become goal after any number of shifts. A shift moves the leftmost character of s to the end.

Approach:
1) Concatenate to Check Rotations: By doubling s to create s + s, any rotated version of s will appear as a substring within this doubled string.
2) Containment Check: Simply check if goal exists as a substring within this concatenated string and if goal has the same length as s.

Key Takeaways:
â€¢ String Concatenation for Rotations: This approach allows checking for all possible rotations in a single containment check.
â€¢ Efficiency: Achieved in O(n)O(n)O(n) time due to substring search, making it both concise and efficient.

ðŸ”— Is Linked List Length Even? Problem Statement: Given a linked list, determine if its length is even.

Approach:
1) Traverse with Toggle: Traverse the linked list, using a simple toggle to flip between even and odd each time a node is encountered.
2) Direct Check: By the end of the traversal, the toggle state directly reveals if the length is even.

Key Takeaways:
â€¢ Minimal Space: This approach doesnâ€™t require counting or storage, using a basic toggle to achieve constant space complexity.
â€¢ Quick Traversal for Linked List Properties: Reinforces the utility of linked list traversal for simple property checks like length.

ðŸ“š Reflections & Learning:
â€¢ Efficient string manipulation through concatenation and substring checks was particularly useful for rotation checks.
â€¢ Linked list traversal for parity checks is a straightforward but powerful method for optimizing simple list properties.
