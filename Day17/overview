Today, I focused on optimizing array sorting and product distribution across stores. Here‚Äôs a quick recap of my approach and takeaways!

üîç Nearly Sorted Array Problem Statement: Given an array where each element is at most k positions away from its target position, sort it without using a direct sorting function.

Approach:
1) Min-Heap for Local Sorting: I utilized a min-heap to handle the element placement within the k-bound. By maintaining a heap of size k+1, I ensured each element was extracted in order, optimizing for the limited disorder.
2) Efficient Insertion & Extraction: By pushing and popping elements within the heap, I efficiently reordered elements without needing a full sort.

Key Takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Heap Efficiency: The min-heap helped achieve an O(n log k) complexity, making this approach ideal for "nearly sorted" constraints.
‚Ä¢ Optimal Space Use: The sliding heap kept space usage low while maintaining order.

üîó Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store Problem Statement: Given a number of products across different types and a fixed number of stores, distribute the products so that the maximum load of any store is minimized.

Approach:
1) Binary Search on Maximum Load: I set up a binary search on the possible maximum store load, calculating how many stores would be needed for each midpoint.
2) Greedy Distribution: With each binary search step, I checked if the midpoint load was feasible by simulating store assignment, balancing load across stores.

Key Takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Binary Search for Load Minimization: Binary search on the maximum load value allowed efficient constraint-based balancing.
‚Ä¢ Greedy Check Optimization: Simulating the distribution with midpoint checks ensured the minimum possible maximum load.

üìö Reflections:
‚Ä¢ Heap Usage in Limited Disorder: Heaps are incredibly useful for scenarios where elements are close to sorted.
‚Ä¢ Binary Search in Allocation Problems: A valuable method for load balancing or allocation problems to find the optimal feasible solution quickly.
