#Day 190 Problem-Solving with #GFG POTD and #Leetcode

Today, I tackled two problems related to string prefix-suffix pairs and triangle formation. Here's a detailed breakdown of my approach and solutions:



Problem 1: Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs

Problem Description:

Given a string array words, find the number of index pairs (i,j) where i<j and words[i] is both a prefix and suffix of words[j].



Approach:

1) Iterate Over All Pairs:

â€¢ For every pair of indices (i,j) with i<j, check if words[i] is a prefix and suffix of words[j].



2) Prefix and Suffix Check:

â€¢ Use string slicing or built-in methods to verify:

words[j].startswith(words[i])

words[j].endswith(words[i]).



3) Count Valid Pairs:

â€¢ Increment the count for every pair that satisfies the condition.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(n2â‹…m), where n is the number of words and mmm is the average length of the words.

â€¢ Space: O(1).



Problem 2: Count the Number of Possible Triangles

Problem Description:

Given an array arr[], find the number of triangles that can be formed using three different elements such that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.



Approach:

1) Sort the Array:

â€¢ Sorting ensures we can efficiently verify the triangle inequality.



2) Two-Pointer Technique:

â€¢ For each element arr[k] (the largest side of the triangle), use two pointers i and j (starting from the beginning and just before k, respectively).



3) Check if arr[i]+arr[j]>arr[k]:

â€¢ If true, all pairs between i and j form valid triangles. Increment the count and move j inward.

If false, increment i.



4) Count Valid Triplets:

â€¢ Repeat for all possible k values.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(n2), where n is the number of elements in the array.

â€¢ Space: O(1).



Reflection:

1) Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs:

â€¢ The prefix-suffix problem emphasized string slicing and efficient pair enumeration.



2) Count the Number of Possible Triangles:

â€¢ Sorting and two-pointer techniques provided an optimal solution for a seemingly brute-force problem.
