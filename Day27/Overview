Today, I focused on problems involving arrays and matrix manipulation, with an emphasis on optimization techniques. Here's what I tackled:

ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: Kadane's Algorithm
Given an integer array arr[]arr[]arr[], find the maximum sum of a subarray. A subarray is a contiguous portion of the array.

Approach:
1) Iterative DP Approach:
â€¢ Use a variable current_sum to track the running sum of the current subarray.
â€¢ Update current_sum as \text{current_sum} = \max(\text{arr}[i], \text{current_sum} + \text{arr}[i]).
Tâ€¢ rack the maximum sum encountered so far with a variable max_sum.
2) Result:
â€¢ The value of max_sum at the end of the iteration is the answer.
2) Edge Case:
â€¢ Handle arrays with all negative numbers by returning the largest element.
3) Challenges Faced:
â€¢ Understanding why the algorithm works so efficiently with just two variables.

Key Takeaway:
â€¢ Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is a powerful tool for maximum subarray problems, offering linear-time complexity while requiring no additional space.

ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: Maximum Matrix Sum
Given an nÃ—n \times nÃ—n integer matrix, you can perform an operation on any two adjacent elements (sharing a border) where both are multiplied by âˆ’1-1âˆ’1. The goal is to maximize the summation of all elements after performing the operations.

Approach:
1) Key Insight:
â€¢ Operations allow flipping signs of adjacent elements, but the overall sum depends on the number of negative elements in the matrix and the smallest absolute value.
2) Steps:
â€¢ Count the total number of negative numbers in the matrix.
â€¢ Calculate the sum of absolute values of all elements.
â€¢ If the count of negatives is even, no extra adjustment is needed; the maximum sum is the sum of absolute values.
â€¢ If the count of negatives is odd, flip the smallest absolute value (minimum element) to achieve the highest possible sum.

3) Result:
â€¢ Return the computed maximum sum.
4) Challenges Faced:
â€¢ Balancing the mathematical reasoning with the constraints of adjacent-element operations.

Key Takeaway:
â€¢ Greedy strategies that focus on the parity of negatives and minimal adjustments often lead to optimal solutions for matrix problems.

ðŸŽ¯ What I Learned Today:
â€¢ Dynamic Programming: Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is not just efficient but intuitive for identifying subarray patterns.
â€¢ Matrix Optimization: Understanding matrix properties, like adjacency and parity, is essential for designing operations effectively.

ðŸ’¡ Reflection: Revisiting fundamental algorithms and applying mathematical reasoning to new problems is a great way to build confidence and reinforce concepts.
