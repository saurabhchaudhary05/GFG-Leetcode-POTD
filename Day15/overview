Today's challenge was all about optimizing selections and scheduling ‚Äì finding the most beautiful items based on price and checking if meeting schedules are feasible without conflicts. üöÄ

üîç Most Beautiful Item for Each Query
Problem Statement: Given a list of items, each with a price and beauty score, and a list of price queries, the task is to find the maximum beauty of an item priced at or below each query price.

Approach:
1) Sort and Prefix Max Array: I sorted items by price, then used a prefix array to maintain maximum beauty up to each price point.
2) Binary Search: For each query, binary search allowed for fast lookups, ensuring efficient retrieval of maximum beauty within the query's price limit.

Key Takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Prefix Arrays & Binary Search: Combining these methods enabled efficient solutions for range-based retrieval.
‚Ä¢ Sorting for Optimization: Sorting upfront simplified the complexity of multiple query evaluations.

üîó Meeting Rooms
Problem Statement: Given an array of meeting time intervals, determine if a person can attend all meetings without overlap.

Approach:
1) Sort by Start Time: I sorted the meetings by start time to easily check for any overlap.
2) Adjacent Comparison: By checking each meeting‚Äôs start time against the previous meeting‚Äôs end time, I confirmed if all meetings could be attended without conflict.

Key Takeaways:
‚Ä¢ Scheduling & Sorting: Sorting and comparing adjacent intervals proved effective for detecting conflicts in scheduling.
‚Ä¢ Event Management Efficiency: This problem reinforced the importance of structured data for efficient scheduling.

üìö Reflections:
‚Ä¢ Efficiency through Data Structuring: Both problems highlight how sorting and prefix-based solutions can greatly enhance performance.
‚Ä¢ Application of Binary Search: The use of binary search in dynamic querying scenarios was instrumental in achieving optimal results.
