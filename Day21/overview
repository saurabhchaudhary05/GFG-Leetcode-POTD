Today's problem-solving session revolved around array manipulation and circular data structures. Here's what I tackled:



🔍 Rotate Array

Problem Statement: Rotate an array counter-clockwise by ddd steps in place.



Approach:

1) Reverse-Based Rotation:

2) Reversed the first ddd elements.

3) Reversed the remaining n−dn-dn−d elements.

4) Reversed the entire array to achieve the desired rotation.

5) In-Place Operation: Avoided using extra space, keeping space complexity at O(1).



Key Takeaways:

• Learned the significance of reversing techniques for efficient rotations.

• Reinforced understanding of modular arithmetic to handle rotations beyond the array's length.



🔗 Defuse the Bomb

Problem Statement: Decrypt a circular array by replacing each element based on the key kkk.



Approach:

1) Circular Sliding Window:

For k>0k > 0k>0, calculated the sum of the next kkk elements using modular arithmetic for wrap-around.

For k<0k < 0k<0, handled sums of previous kkk elements similarly.



2) Used an auxiliary array to avoid overwriting during simultaneous updates.

3) Edge Cases: Accounted for k=0k = 0k=0 by directly setting elements to 0.



Key Takeaways:

• Circular arrays require careful handling of indices, especially for wrap-around operations.

• Leveraged sliding window techniques to efficiently compute segment sums.



📚 Reflections:

• Array manipulation problems deepen understanding of space-efficient solutions.

• Circular structures introduce unique challenges, fostering innovative problem-solving approaches.
