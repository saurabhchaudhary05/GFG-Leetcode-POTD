#Day 177 Problem-Solving with #GFG POTD and #Leetcode

Today, I solved two problems related to string matching and prefix searching. Here's a breakdown of my approach and solutions:



Problem 1: Find Largest Value in Each Tree Row

Problem Description

Given the root of a binary tree, return an array of the largest value in each row of the tree.



Approach:

1) Level Order Traversal (BFS):

â€¢ Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) on the tree.

â€¢ Traverse the tree level by level and find the maximum value at each level.

â€¢ Use a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

â€¢ Space: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the tree (the largest number of nodes at any level).



Problem 2: Set Matrix Zeroes

Problem Description

Given a nÃ—n \times mÃ—m matrix mat[][], modify the matrix such that if mat[i][j]=0, then all elements in the i-th row and j-th column are set to 0, while doing so in constant space complexity.



Approach:

1) Marking Rows and Columns Using First Row and Column:

â€¢ Use the first row and first column as markers for which rows and columns need to be zeroed.

2) Traverse the matrix:

â€¢ If mat[i][j]=0, set mat[i][0]=0and mat[0][j]=0.

3) Zero Out the Matrix Using Markers:

â€¢ Iterate through the matrix (excluding the first row and column):

â€¢ If mat[i][0]=0 or mat[0][j]=0, set mat[i][j]=0.

4) Handle the First Row and Column Separately:

â€¢ After processing the rest of the matrix, handle the first row and column based on their original values.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(nÃ—m).

â€¢ Space: O(1), as we use the matrix itself for marking.



Reflection:

1) Tree Row Maximum:

â€¢ Solidified BFS traversal skills. Managing data at each level during traversal was crucial.

2) Matrix Zeroing:

â€¢ This problem highlights how to cleverly reuse space (first row and column) for marking while adhering to space constraints.

â€¢ Both problems were satisfying and strengthened concepts of tree traversal and matrix manipulation.
