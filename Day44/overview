Today's challenges focused on maximizing array properties under constraints and performing efficient in-place operations on sorted arrays. Here's an overview:

Problem 1: Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation
Problem Description
You are tasked to maximize the beauty of an array. You can replace each element nums[i] with any value in the range [nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k]. The beauty of the array is defined as the length of the longest subsequence of equal elements.

Example:
Input:
nums = [4, 6, 1, 4], k = 2
Output:
3
Explanation:
Replace the first 4 with 5, the second 4 with 5, and 6 with 5. The resulting array can be [5, 5, 5, 5], and the beauty is 4.

Approach:
1) Transform Ranges:
• Each element can be replaced within a range, e.g., nums[i] ± k.

2) Sort and Sweep:
• Sort the array to process the ranges in increasing order.
• Use a sliding window or two-pointer technique to determine the longest range where values can overlap, representing equal elements.

3) Count Overlaps:
• Incrementally count elements that fit into the same target range while maintaining the maximum count.

Complexity:
• Time: O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for the sliding window.
• Space: O(1) for in-place operations.

Key Takeaway:
• Sorting and sliding windows are powerful tools for solving range-based constraints efficiently.

Problem 2: Merge Without Extra Space
Problem Description
Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[] of sizes n and m respectively, merge them in-place such that:
The first n elements belong to a[].
The last m elements belong to b[].

Example:
Input:
a = [1, 3, 5, 7]
b = [0, 2, 6, 8, 9]
Output:
a = [0, 1, 2, 3]
b = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Approach:
1) Gap Method:
• Treat both arrays as a single combined array.
• Start with an initial gap size, gap = ceil((n + m) / 2).
• Compare and swap elements separated by the gap, reducing the gap size after each iteration.

2) Efficient Swapping:
• Compare within a[] for indices i and i + gap.
• Compare across a[] and b[] for indices i in a[] and j in b[].
• Compare within b[] for indices j and j + gap.
• Iterate Until Gap Becomes 1:
• When the gap reduces to 1, perform the final pass to ensure sorted order.

Complexity:
• Time: O((n + m) log(n + m)) due to gap reduction and comparisons.
• Space: O(1) as the operation is in-place.

Key Takeaway:
• The Gap Method is a classic and efficient technique for merging arrays in-place without additional memory overhead.
