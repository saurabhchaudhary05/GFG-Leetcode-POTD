Today’s challenges covered the concepts of graph traversal and string manipulation. Here's an overview of the problems and their solutions:

Problem 1: Valid Arrangement of Pairs
Given a 2D integer array pairs, where each pair[i] = [startᵢ, endᵢ], the task is to arrange the pairs such that:
For every index i (1 ≤ i < pairs.length), endᵢ₋₁ == startᵢ.
The input is guaranteed to have at least one valid arrangement.

Approach
1) Graph Representation:
• Treat each pair [startᵢ, endᵢ] as a directed edge in a graph.
• Use the startᵢ as the source and endᵢ as the destination.
2) Eulerian Path:
• A valid arrangement corresponds to finding an Eulerian path in the directed graph.
• Use in-degree and out-degree checks to identify the starting node for the path.

3) Hierholzer’s Algorithm:
• Use Hierholzer’s algorithm to construct the Eulerian path.
• Maintain a stack to backtrack and construct the arrangement.
4) Result Construction:
• Reverse the constructed Eulerian path to obtain the correct order of pairs.

5) Key Takeaways
This problem was an excellent exercise in graph theory, specifically Eulerian paths, and it emphasized how to handle connectivity and degree conditions efficiently.

Problem 2: Anagram
Problem Description
Given two strings s1 and s2, check whether they are anagrams.
An anagram means both strings contain the same characters with the same frequency, irrespective of order.

Approach
1) Frequency Counting:
• Use a hash table or array to count character frequencies for both strings.
• Compare the frequency tables to check for equality.
• Sorting (Alternative Approach):
• Sort both strings and compare their sorted forms.
• If equal, the strings are anagrams.

2) Edge Cases:
• Strings of different lengths cannot be anagrams.
• Handle all lowercase alphabets efficiently.
3) Key Takeaways
• This problem reinforced the importance of efficient frequency counting and the utility of sorting for comparison tasks.

Reflection
Today's problems were a mix of advanced graph concepts and foundational string manipulation. While the "Valid Arrangement of Pairs" problem required a deeper understanding of Eulerian paths, the "Anagram" problem provided a simpler yet essential review of frequency counting techniques.
