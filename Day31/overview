Today's problem-solving journey involved two exciting challenges: one focusing on string manipulation and another on graph traversal. Here's a detailed breakdown:

Problem 1: Implement Atoi
Problem Description
Convert a given string s into a 32-bit signed integer without using built-in conversion functions. This involves handling leading whitespaces, optional signs, invalid characters, and overflow conditions.

Approach
1) Trimming Whitespaces:
• Skip all leading whitespaces to locate the numeric part of the string.
2) Checking for Sign:
• Detect a '+' or '-' sign at the start to determine the polarity. Default to positive if no sign is present.
3) Extracting Digits:
• Parse the string, extracting digits until a non-numeric character is encountered. Ignore leading zeros.
4) Handling Overflow:
• Compare the number being formed against the 32-bit integer limits:
• If it exceeds 2^31 - 1 (2147483647), return 2147483647.
• If it drops below -2^31 (-2147483648), return -2147483648.
5) Key Takeaways
• This problem taught me the importance of robust edge-case handling, especially with special conditions like invalid characters, signs, and overflow scenarios.

Problem 2: Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner
Given an m x n grid containing 0s (empty cells) and 1s (obstacles), find the minimum number of obstacles to remove to travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, using four-directional movement.

Approach
1) Graph Representation:
• Treat the grid as a graph, where each cell is a node.
• 0-1 BFS Algorithm:
• Use a double-ended queue (deque) to manage nodes efficiently.
• Add cells with no obstacles (weight 0) to the front of the deque.
• Add cells with obstacles (weight 1) to the back of the deque.

2) Pathfinding:
• Use BFS to explore all possible paths to the destination while minimizing the number of obstacles removed.
• Keep a visited matrix to avoid redundant calculations and ensure optimal traversal.

3) Key Takeaways
• The problem enhanced my understanding of BFS variations and demonstrated the real-world application of pathfinding in weighted grids. 
• Implementing the 0-1 BFS algorithm was particularly insightful.

Reflection
• Both problems were excellent exercises in algorithm design and edge-case handling. While Atoi reinforced precision in string processing, the obstacle removal problem highlighted the efficiency of specialized graph traversal techniques like 0-1 BFS. Today’s session added valuable skills to my problem-solving arsenal.
