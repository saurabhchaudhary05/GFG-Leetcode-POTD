#Day 204 Problem-Solving Recap

Today's problem-solving involved an interesting combination of matrix-based logic and complex linked list manipulation. Here's the breakdown:



Problem 1: Count Servers that Communicate

Problem Description:

Given a matrix grid of size mÃ—nm \times nmÃ—n, where 1 represents a server and 0 represents no server, find the number of servers that can communicate with at least one other server. Two servers communicate if they are in the same row or column.



Approach:

1) Count Servers Per Row and Column:

â€¢ Use two arrays, rowCount and colCount, to store the count of servers in each row and column.



2) Traverse the Grid:

â€¢ For each cell (i, j) in the grid:

â€¢ If grid[i][j] == 1, increment rowCount[i] and colCount[j].



3) Calculate the Result:

â€¢ Traverse the grid again, and for each server (grid[i][j] == 1):

â€¢ Check if rowCount[i] > 1 or colCount[j] > 1. If true, it can communicate.



4) Output the Count:

â€¢ Return the total number of such servers.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(mÃ—n) â€” One pass for counting rows/columns, and one pass for checking communicable servers.

â€¢ Space: O(m+n) â€” Space for rowCount and colCount.



Problem 2: Clone List with Next and Random

Problem Description:

Given a linked list where each node has two pointers (next and random), create a deep copy of the list such that:

The copied list maintains the same structure.

None of the pointers in the copied list point to the original list.



Approach:

1_ Insert Cloned Nodes:

â€¢ Traverse the original list and insert a cloned node after each original node.

â€¢ For example, convert A -> B -> C to A -> A' -> B -> B' -> C -> C'.



2) Assign Random Pointers:

â€¢ Traverse the list again and assign the random pointer of each cloned node.

â€¢ If original.random exists, set original.next.random = original.random.next.



3) Separate the Lists:

â€¢ Split the interwoven list into the original and the cloned list.

â€¢ Restore the original list's structure.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list.

â€¢ Space: O(1) additional space (besides the output list), as the solution modifies the list in-place during copying.



Reflection:

1) Count Servers that Communicate:

â€¢ Using row and column counts simplified the problem significantly, avoiding the need for complex connectivity checks.



2) Clone List with Next and Random:

â€¢ The in-place node insertion trick minimized extra space usage, which is a key optimization for problems involving linked lists with additional pointers.
