#Day 160 Problem-Solving with #GFG POTD and #Leetcode

Today's challenges revolved around maximizing value from non-overlapping intervals and merging overlapping intervals in a 2D space. Here's an analysis of the problems and their solutions:



Problem 1: Two Best Non-Overlapping Events

Problem Description

Given a 2D array events, where events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei], find the maximum sum of values you can achieve by attending at most two non-overlapping events.



Example:

Input:

events = [[1, 3, 4], [2, 4, 6], [5, 6, 8]]

Output:

12

Explanation:

Attend the second and third events for a total value of 6 + 8 = 12.



Approach:

1) Sort Events by End Time:

• Sorting helps ensure efficient comparison of overlapping intervals.



2) Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Events:

• Use a binary search (on start times) to find the last event that does not overlap with the current event.



3) Dynamic Programming:

• Use a DP-like approach to maintain the maximum value achievable with one event up to each point.

• Iterate through the sorted list and update the result by considering the current event and a non-overlapping prior event.



4) Steps:

• Sort events based on their end times.

• Iterate through each event, and for each, use binary search to find the best non-overlapping event.

• Track the maximum sum using dynamic programming.



Complexity:

• Time: O(n log n) (Sorting + Binary Search for each event).

• Space: O(n) for storing DP values.



Key Takeaway:

• Efficiently combining sorting and binary search enables solving interval-based problems within optimal time complexity.



Problem 2: Overlapping Intervals

Problem Description

Given an array arr[][], where arr[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals into one.

Example:

Input:

arr = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [6, 8], [7, 9]]

Output:

[[1, 4], [6, 9]]



Approach:

1) Sort by Start Time:

• Sorting ensures intervals are considered in increasing order of start times.



2) Merge Intervals:

• Iterate through the sorted list and compare each interval with the last merged interval.

• If they overlap, merge them; otherwise, add the new interval to the result.



3) Steps:

• Sort the intervals by their start times.

• Initialize a result array with the first interval.

• Iterate through the remaining intervals, checking for overlaps and merging where necessary.



Complexity:

• Time: O(n log n) (Sorting + Iteration).

• Space: O(n) for storing merged intervals.



Key Takeaway:

• Sorting intervals by their start times simplifies the logic for merging overlapping ranges.
