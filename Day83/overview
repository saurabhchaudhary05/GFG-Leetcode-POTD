#Day 203 Problem-Solving Recap

Today's problem-solving session involved tackling two medium-difficulty problems, one on grid traversal and another on linked list manipulation. Here's a breakdown:



Problem 1: Map of Highest Peak

Problem Description:

Given a matrix isWater representing land and water cells, assign heights to all cells such that:

Water cells have height 0.

Adjacent cells have a height difference of at most 1.

The maximum height in the matrix is maximized.

Return the resulting height matrix.



Approach:

1) Breadth-First Search (BFS):

‚Ä¢ Treat all water cells as the starting points for BFS with height 0.

‚Ä¢ Use a queue to propagate heights to adjacent cells, incrementing height by 1 at each step.

‚Ä¢ This ensures that the height assignment satisfies the adjacency condition.



2) Initialization:

‚Ä¢ Initialize the height matrix with -1 for land cells and 0 for water cells.

‚Ä¢ Add all water cells to the BFS queue.



3) Processing:

‚Ä¢ For each cell dequeued, calculate heights for its unvisited neighbors (cells still marked -1).



4) Result:

‚Ä¢ The BFS guarantees the heights are assigned optimally, maximizing the highest peak.



Complexity:

‚Ä¢ Time: O(m√ón), where m and n are the matrix dimensions. Each cell is processed once.

‚Ä¢ Space: O(m√ón) for the queue and the height matrix.



Problem 2: Add Number Linked Lists

Problem Description:

Given two singly linked lists num1 and num2 representing two non-negative integers, return their sum as a linked list. The integers are stored in reverse order, and the output should not have leading zeros.



Approach:

1) Simulate Addition Digit by Digit:

‚Ä¢ Initialize a dummy node for the result linked list and a carry variable.

‚Ä¢ Traverse both input lists, adding corresponding digits along with the carry.

‚Ä¢ Create a new node for the sum's last digit and update the carry.



2) Handle Remaining Digits:

‚Ä¢ If one list is longer, continue adding its digits with the carry.

‚Ä¢ If there's a carry left after processing both lists, add a final node for it.



Return Result:

‚Ä¢ Return the next node of the dummy as the head of the result list.



Complexity:

‚Ä¢ Time: O(max‚Å°(n,m)), where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.

‚Ä¢ Space: O(max‚Å°(n,m)), for the result linked list.



Reflection:

1) Map of Highest Peak:

‚Ä¢ Leveraging multi-source BFS ensured that the height assignment was optimal while maintaining adjacency constraints.



2) Add Number Linked Lists:

‚Ä¢ Maintaining the carry and using a dummy node simplified the implementation, ensuring the code was concise and error-free.
