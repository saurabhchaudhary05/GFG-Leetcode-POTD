Problem 1: Search in a Strictly Sorted Matrix
Problem Description
Given a strictly sorted 2D matrix mat[][] of size n×m and a number x, determine if x is present in the matrix.
A strictly sorted matrix means:
Each row is sorted in strictly increasing order.
The first element of a row is greater than the last element of the previous row.

Approach:
1) Flatten the Matrix into a Virtual 1D Array:
2) Treat the matrix as a single sorted 1D array.
3) Use binary search to find the element:
4) Binary Search on Rows:
• Use binary search to determine which row xxx might belong to.
• Perform binary search on the identified row.

Complexity:
• Time: O(log⁡(n×m)) for the virtual array approach.
• Space: O(1).

Problem 2: Minimum Diameter After Merging Two Trees
Problem Description
Given two undirected trees T1 with nnn nodes and T2 with m nodes, you must connect one node from T1 to another node from T2 to form a single tree.
The goal is to minimize the diameter of the resulting tree.
Tree Diameter: The length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

Approach:
1) Diameter of Individual Trees:
• Compute the diameter of both trees using a two-pass BFS or DFS:
• Start from an arbitrary node and find the farthest node u.
• Start from u and find the farthest node v.
• The path from uuu to v is the diameter.
2) Identify Maximum Heights:
• For both trees, identify the nodes with the maximum height using BFS or DFS.
3) Merge Strategy:
• Connect the tallest nodes of T1 and T2.

Complexity:
• Time: O(n+m), as we compute heights and diameters for both trees.
• Space: O(n+m) for storing adjacency lists and BFS/DFS stacks.

Reflection:
1) Matrix Search:
• Reinforced understanding of binary search in a virtual 1D array. This approach highlights the power of conceptual transformations in matrix problems.

2) Tree Diameter Reduction:
• This problem demonstrates the importance of understanding tree properties and combining them creatively. It required a mix of diameter computation, height analysis, and a strategic merge to minimize the result.
Both problems were intellectually stimulating, combining foundational concepts with optimization.
