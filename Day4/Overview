Today’s problems revolved around circular string validation and detecting nearby duplicates. Here’s a quick summary:

📝 2490. Circular Sentence Problem Statement: Given a sentence, determine if it is circular, meaning:
The last character of each word matches the first character of the following word.
The last character of the final word matches the first character of the first word.

Approach:
1) Split and Check: First, split the sentence into words using spaces.
2) Character Comparison: For each consecutive word pair, check if the last character of the first word matches the first character of the second word. 
3) Finally, check if the last word’s last character matches the first word’s first character to ensure circularity.
4) Return Result: If all conditions are met, the sentence is circular.

Key Takeaways:
• Edge Cases: This approach works well for sentences with only one word, where it’s automatically circular.
• String Manipulation: String splitting and character checking reinforce handling constraints with minimal loops.

🔗 Kth Distance Duplicate Check Problem Statement: Given an array and a number kkk, determine if there are any duplicate elements within kkk distance of each other in the array.

Approach:
1) Sliding Window with Set: Maintain a set to keep track of elements within the kkk-distance window.
2) Check for Duplicates: As we slide the window, check if the current element already exists in the set, indicating a duplicate within kkk distance.
3) Adjust Window: Add the current element to the set and remove elements that are more than kkk positions away to keep the window size in check.

Key Takeaways:
• Efficiency with Sets: Using a set allows for O(1)O(1)O(1) average time complexity in checking for duplicates.
• Window Management: This approach highlights efficient sliding window handling without redundant checks.

📚 Reflections & Learning:
• Today’s problems reinforced sliding window usage with constraints on proximity and efficient handling of circular conditions.
• Breaking down string and array manipulation into systematic checks simplifies logical constraints.
