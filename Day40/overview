Today's challenges involved optimizing operations on arrays and leveraging efficient algorithms to count inversions. Here's an overview of the problems, solutions, and insights:

Problem 1: Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag
Problem Description
Given an array nums where nums[i] represents the number of balls in the ith bag and an integer maxOperations, divide the balls into new bags such that the penalty (maximum balls in any bag) is minimized.

Example:
Input:
nums = [9, 7, 5], maxOperations = 3
Output:
5

Approach
1) Binary Search on Penalty:
• Define the range of penalties from 1 to max(nums).
• For each potential penalty, check if it’s feasible to achieve using at most maxOperations.

2) Feasibility Check:
• For each bag in nums, calculate the number of splits needed to ensure the number of balls in each bag is ≤ current penalty.
• Sum the splits and ensure they don’t exceed maxOperations.

3) Steps:
• Perform binary search on penalties.
• Use the feasibility check to adjust the search range.

4) Complexity:
• Time: O(n * log(max(nums))) for binary search and feasibility check.
• Space: O(1).

5) Key Takeaway:
• The problem highlights the power of binary search in minimizing or maximizing constraints in optimization problems.

Problem 2: Count Inversions
Problem Description
Find the inversion count in an array, where an inversion is defined as a pair (i, j) such that arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j.

Example:
Input:
arr = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output:
3

Approach
1) Divide and Conquer (Merge Sort):
• During the merge process of merge sort, count the number of inversions.
• If arr[i] > arr[j] and i < j, then all remaining elements in the left subarray are also greater than arr[j].

2) Steps:
• Split the array recursively.
• Count inversions during the merge step by comparing elements from the two halves.

3) Complexity:
• Time: O(n log n) due to merge sort.
• Space: O(n) for temporary arrays used in merging.

Key Takeaway:
• Using merge sort not only sorts the array efficiently but also enables counting inversions during the merge step, demonstrating the versatility of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
