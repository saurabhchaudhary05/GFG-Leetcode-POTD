Today‚Äôs problems focused on modifying arrays to meet specific criteria, including making one sorted by removing the fewest elements and finding the second largest distinct element. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my approach and key takeaways!



üîç Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted 

Problem Statement: Given an integer array, find the shortest subarray (can be empty) to remove so that the remaining elements form a non-decreasing sequence.



Approach:

1) Two-Pointer Technique: First, I identified the longest non-decreasing subarrays from the left and right.

2) Bridging Left and Right: Then, I calculated the minimum removal length by checking where elements from the right subarray could attach to the left, ensuring a non-decreasing order.

3) Minimizing Removals: By considering various start and end points, I minimized the size of the removed subarray.



Key Takeaways:

‚Ä¢ Efficiency with Two Pointers: The two-pointer approach allowed for a linear time solution, making it efficient even for larger arrays.

‚Ä¢ Handling Edge Cases: I accounted for cases where no removal was necessary or where a large portion of the array needed to be removed.



üîó Finding the Second Largest Element Problem Statement: Given an array of positive integers, find the second largest element that is distinct from the largest, or return -1 if it doesn‚Äôt exist.



Approach:

1) Tracking Max and Second Max: I traversed the array once, updating the largest and second-largest elements while ensuring they were distinct.

2) Single-Pass Solution: This method achieved linear time complexity, as I only needed a single pass to identify the two largest unique elements.



Key Takeaways:

‚Ä¢ Direct Approach for Efficiency: By simply keeping track of two variables, I was able to find the answer with minimal processing.

‚Ä¢ Distinctness Check: Ensuring that the second largest was distinct from the largest added a level of validation crucial for edge cases.



üìö Reflections:

‚Ä¢ Array Manipulation Techniques: Efficiently identifying and removing subarrays can drastically reduce the need for full array traversals.

‚Ä¢ Distinct Element Tracking: Simple variables can be powerful for tracking the largest and second-largest elements while maintaining distinctions.
