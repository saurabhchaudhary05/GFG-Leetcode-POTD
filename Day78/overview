#Day 198 Problem-Solving with #GFG POTD and #Leetcode

Today, I solved two exciting problems related to bitwise operations and array-based manipulations. Here's a breakdown of my approach and solutions:



Problem 1: Neighboring Bitwise XOR

Problem Description:

Given a derived array, determine if there exists a valid binary array (only 0s and 1s) such that the derived array is obtained by XORing adjacent elements (with wrap-around) in the binary array.



Approach:

1) XOR Properties:

â€¢ The derived array elements are calculated using original[i]âŠ•original[(i+1)modâ€‰â€‰n].

â€¢ To reverse the process, deduce possible values for the original array based on XOR consistency.



2) Circular Dependency:

â€¢ Since the XOR operation wraps around, ensure consistency by trying both possible starting values for original[0].



3) Validation:

â€¢ Assume original[0] = 0 and construct the array.

â€¢ Assume original[0] = 1 and construct again.

â€¢ Check if either assumption fully satisfies the derived array.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(n), as the array is processed twice.

â€¢ Space: O(1), since no extra storage is used.



Problem 2: Product Array Puzzle

Problem Description:

Given an array, construct a product array where each element is the product of all elements in the input array except itself. Avoid division operations.



Approach:

1) Prefix and Suffix Products:

â€¢ Compute the prefix product for every element.

â€¢ Compute the suffix product for every element.

â€¢ For each index i, calculate the result as res[i]=prefix[iâˆ’1]Ã—suffix[i+1].



2) Optimized Space Usage:

â€¢ Avoid explicit prefix/suffix arrays by using cumulative products stored in variables.



Complexity:

â€¢ Time: O(n), as we compute prefix and suffix products in single traversals.

â€¢ Space: O(1), only variables are used for computation.



Reflection:

1) Neighboring Bitwise XOR:

â€¢ XOR-based problems are fascinating as they require understanding both properties and reversing computations effectively.

Handling circular dependencies was key to the solution.



2) Product Array Puzzle:

â€¢ Avoiding division and utilizing prefix-suffix products was an efficient approach that minimized space usage.
