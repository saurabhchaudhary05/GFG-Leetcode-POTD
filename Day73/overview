Today's problems focused on parentheses validation and rainwater trapping. Here's how I approached them:

Problem 1: Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid
Problem Description:
You are given a parentheses string s and a binary string locked of the same length. If locked[i] = '1', the character s[i] cannot be changed; otherwise, it can be replaced with either '(' or ')'. Determine if s can be modified into a valid parentheses string.

Approach:
1) Key Observations:
â€¢ A valid parentheses string must balance the number of open and close brackets.
â€¢ Replaceable positions (locked[i] = '0') can be adjusted to balance the string.

2) Two-Pass Validation:
â€¢ Left-to-Right Check: Ensure that open brackets ( can cover close brackets ) up to each index.
â€¢ Right-to-Left Check: Ensure that close brackets ) can cover open brackets ( up to each index.

3) Conditions for Validity:
â€¢ If both checks pass, the string can be made valid; otherwise, it cannot.

Complexity:
â€¢ Time: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
â€¢ Space: O(1), as no additional data structures are used.

Problem 2: Trapping Rain Water
Problem Description:
Given an array arr[] representing block heights, calculate the amount of water that can be trapped between the blocks after raining.

Approach:
1) Key Observations:
â€¢ The water trapped above a block depends on the minimum of the tallest blocks to its left and right, minus the height of the block itself.

2) Two-Pointer Technique:
â€¢ Use two pointers (left and right) to traverse the array.
â€¢ Maintain the maximum heights seen so far from both ends (left_max and right_max).
â€¢ Calculate trapped water at each step based on the smaller of left_max and right_max.

Steps:
â€¢ If left_max is smaller, calculate water trapped at left and increment left.
â€¢ Otherwise, calculate water trapped at right and decrement right.

Complexity:
â€¢ Time: O(n), where n is the size of the array.
â€¢ Space: O(1), as the solution uses constant space.

Reflection:
1) Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid:
â€¢ The two-pass method effectively handled locked characters while maintaining balance, showcasing the importance of directional checks.

Trapping Rain Water:
â€¢ The two-pointer approach minimized space usage while maintaining linear complexity, making it optimal for large inputs.
